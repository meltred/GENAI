              "'## Summary of arXiv:2302.13971vl\\n\\nThis paper introduces LLaMA, a collection of foundation language models ranging from 7B to 65B parameters. The models are trained on trillions of tokens from publicly available datasets, demonstrating that state-of-the-art performance can be achieved without relying on proprietary data. LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 (175B) on most benchmarks, and LLaMA-65B is competitive with the best models, Chinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B. All models are released to the research community.\\n\\n**Keywords:** LLaMA, foundation language models, open access, public datasets, GPT-3, Chinchilla, PaLM\\n\\n**Retrieval cues:** LLaMA, open access, public datasets, language models, benchmarks, GPT-3, Chinchilla, PaLM'"
